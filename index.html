  <div class="bio" <p> his own current and evolving database of old clothes is his blueprint for creation, reformatting his own worn-out but distinctive wardrobe. every old garment holds a rich and unique narrative which geordie seeks to reveal and
    exploit. he integrates sophisticated and characteristic finishes into his work to elevate what might initially appear as ordinary garments. the clothes are primary, and their intention is, first and foremost, to be worn. they become lifelong
    friends. they are regular wearable pieces, but it is their formation of fabric that soon reveals a complex and convoluted history. his practice is genuine and normalises the bizarre, using spaghetti as shampoo. the clothes are like an awkward
    person with strange routines that no one knows about. geordie’s work doesn’t draw unwanted attention, it reminds you of night creatures, it walks on all fours like a cat. geordie’s practice implies that the value of a garment appreciates as long
    as it exists.
